NOTES =========================

25/05/21 - We have just released new versions of the OMM server (0.6.0) and client (0.3.0) software.

21/02/21 - Download the match-to-sample.osexp and match-to-sample-jobs.csv and use these to create a study on the OMM Server. 
(You can use your own OMM server if it's up to date, or omm.cogsci.nl, which will work but of course is a bit slower, so expect 1 or 2 s delays.) This experiment never finishes, so it's convenient for testing (and as a default study later).
Create a participant with an ID that matches the RFID on one of your test sticks, and assign this participant to the study.
Install/ update opensesame-extension-omm >= 0.2.5 ideally on the latest version of OpenSesame (3.3.8). See the readme for installation instructions. Restart OpenSesame when this done.
Launch a session through Menu → Tools → OMM client as before, but this time selecting the RFID identification method. 
I suggest using the legacy backend. 
By default, the RFID is on COM3 and the seed dispenser on COM4 (as per your examples), 
but you can change this by adding omm_condition_port: COM8 and/ or omm_rfid_port: COM7 to the YAML data (on my system they are on COM7 and 8).
